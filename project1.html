    <h1>All About Starkey!!!</h1>
    <p>Douglas Quin Starkey was the former middle school technology tteacher at Academy Charter School. He taught Abigail and all of the class how to code. He was really great. Abigail called him Mr. Hater, and they were best friends. Even though she was scared of him at first, they bacame best friends the next year when Lindsey was in the class. Abigail and Lindsey coded  websites about him called "We Sell Starkey Stuff" and "We Sell Starkey Merchandise" as a competion. They went on a trip to Google in Boulder which was REALLY fun, and Abigail and Lindsey promised they would come and visit. Sadly, over the summer Douglas Quin Starkey announced that he would be leaving the school and would be taking a postion as a computers teacher at a school closer to his house. Abigail and Lindsey could no longer visit and annoy him. They were all sad. THE END </p>
